- 👋 Hi, I’m @80Duce and I am studying to be a developer via Code Academy. I have finished HTML5, CSS, CSS advanced, and of coarse a class for GitHub. I am currently working on to be a Full Stack developer. I do have my first web page deployed at morsecode.cool, but I still need to go back and work on making a better website for me now that I have learned so much more as a developer.

- 👀 I’m interested in Salmon fishing, hicking, working out, and going to the pistol range.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced HTML5 and the Full Stack developer coarse.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project at some point when I have more experince.
- 📫 How to reach me for now through GitHub.
